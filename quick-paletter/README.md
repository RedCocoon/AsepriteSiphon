## IMPORTANT!!!
When you first install the extension and used the "Palette from URL" function, allow the script full access on the security pop up. Otherwise, the app will crash. Also before you use that function, make sure to save everything, as there seems to be rare crashes? Idk, if someone else can help me debug and fix my code it would be great.

## User Guide
- Three new options are added under Sprite on top left
- Click the first option "Check API Version" and make sure the last output is false
- New Palette from File generate new palette from the selected file
- New Palette from URL generate new palette from the image linked
- Please do not put non-image url in there, I don't even know what will happen owo

## Known problems
- "Websocket Error" Popup: as far as I can tell, it is completely fine.
- If the plugin doesn't work, try changing the port where the code says "localhost:[PORT]"
