## IMPORTANT!!!
When you first install the extension and used the "Palette from URL" function, allow the script full access on the security pop up. Otherwise, the app will crash. Also before you use that function, make sure to save everything, as there seems to be rare crashes? Idk, if someone else can help me debug and fix my code it would be great.

## Known problems
- "Websocket Error" Popup: as far as I can tell, it is completely fine.
- If the plugin doesn't work, try changing the port where the code says "localhost:[PORT]"
